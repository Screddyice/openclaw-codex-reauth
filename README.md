# openclaw-codex-reauth

Headless, unattended re-authentication for OpenAI Codex CLI OAuth on remote servers (OpenClaw fleet or any server running `codex`).

When Codex's refresh-token chain breaks (OpenAI rotates / expires the refresh token roughly every 10 days), Codex stops working until a human opens a browser and logs back in. This project automates that re-login on each server so the loop self-heals with no operator involvement.

## Architecture

Each server runs two things on a schedule:

1. **Watchdog** (`codex_watchdog.py`, cron every 15 min): cheap check on token TTL. If the access token is still healthy, exit. If it's near expiry, try an API refresh. If the refresh chain is broken (`invalid_grant`), escalate to the recovery flow.

2. **Recovery** (`codex_reauth_server.py`, invoked by the watchdog on escalation): launches a real Chrome over CDP, walks the OpenAI auth URL, submits the configured email, waits for OpenAI's verification email to arrive in Gmail (via read-only Gmail API), extracts the magic link or 6-digit code, completes the login, catches the auth callback on localhost, exchanges the code for fresh tokens, writes them into the server's `auth-profiles.json`, and restarts the OpenClaw gateway.

A Mac-side companion script (`codex_reauth_mac.py`) runs the same flow from a real desktop browser and pushes fresh tokens to servers via SSH. Used as a manual tier-2 fallback when the headless server flow fails.

### Dual-write to Codex CLI 0.128.0+

Codex CLI 0.128.0 introduced a dedicated token store at `~/.codex/auth.json` (richer schema with `tokens.id_token`, `tokens.account_id`, `auth_mode`, `last_refresh`). Both the `codex` CLI itself and OpenClaw consume the same OAuth tokens but read them from different files.

To keep both stores in lock-step, every refresh and every fresh login writes to **both**:

- OpenClaw's `auth-profiles.json` (and `oauth-token-cache.json`)
- Codex CLI's `~/.codex/auth.json` (merged — non-token fields like `auth_mode` are preserved; missing `id_token` on a refresh response keeps the existing one)

The watchdog also reads from `~/.codex/auth.json` as a fallback if OpenClaw's profile is missing — useful for hosts where `codex login` was run directly (or tokens were pushed there from a Mac) before OpenClaw was configured.

## The datacenter-IP problem

OpenAI's login page silently rejects new-device attempts from datacenter IPs (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.) by suppressing email delivery. The headless server flow only works when the server's outbound traffic appears to come from a residential IP.

Two supported patterns:

- **Reverse SSH SOCKS tunnel from a home device** (the original Mac-based approach — see `socks_proxy.py`). The server's Chrome launches with `--proxy-server=socks5://127.0.0.1:1080` and exits through a trusted residential connection.
- **Static residential proxy service** (recommended for fully unattended operation). A static residential IP (e.g., via IPRoyal) is reachable from both servers via a small `gost` sidecar on `127.0.0.1:1080`. Same code path, no home device required. Covered in `docs/specs/2026-04-23-residential-proxy-codex-reauth-design.md`.

Either way, `codex_reauth_server.py` auto-detects a SOCKS proxy on `127.0.0.1:1080` and uses it.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. On each server
git clone https://github.com/Screddyice/openclaw-codex-reauth.git ~/codex-reauth
cd ~/codex-reauth
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium

# 2. Copy the example configs and fill them in
cp config.server.example.json config.server.json
#   edit: openai_email, chrome_path, systemd unit names

# 3. Seed a Gmail OAuth credential that can read the inbox that receives
#    OpenAI's verification emails. Store as ~/.openclaw/gmail-oauth-credentials.json:
#      { "client_id", "client_secret", "refresh_token", "token_uri", "email" }

# 4. Install the watchdog on a 15-min cron
crontab -l 2>/dev/null | { cat; echo "*/15 * * * * $HOME/codex-reauth/venv/bin/python $HOME/codex-reauth/codex_watchdog.py >> $HOME/.openclaw-oauth/watchdog.log 2>&1"; } | crontab -

# 5. Bring up a residential exit (one of the two patterns above) so the
#    recovery flow has a non-datacenter IP to use.
```

## Status

Production on two servers (NEB / Cliqk). API-level refresh is reliable. Headless recovery is reliable when a residential exit is available; see `docs/specs/2026-04-23-residential-proxy-codex-reauth-design.md` for the current work to make the residential exit always-available.
